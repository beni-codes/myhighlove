You talk to friends, but, friend, I know,
you speak to none but yourself,
knowing you'll remain unheard,
[[Misinterpreted, Misunderstood, Mistook]]

But, friend, while they might hear your [[Sound]],
I will make sure it is heard.
And when their mind waver off and forget to listen,
know, mine will be there, listening to you true.

Because what you say is worth more
than cobwebs and flies.
See, even the cobwebs out here
hold back all the empty lies.
And flies - they come and disappear.

So when the world tries
to shake your ribs and reach your heart,
know I'll never leave your side.
I'll watch from above,
I'll be your right and fight your fight.

Friend, remember, I am patient.
And when you start to drown again,
the bottom will be tempting.
But, rise - we can always try again,
I will keep your image kempt, so sing!

I am no father, but I'll prove you are lovely.
I have no experience with friends,
but, friend, I'm sure it is so lovely,
knowing we are unbound by trends:
not grasped at all by hands of cowardly.
