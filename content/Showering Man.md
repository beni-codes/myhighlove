Hack, hack, hack
I dissolve till I make it unable to enact
Then the gaze holds
My eyes, what do you behold?

I am a killer
No soul has seen me simmer
Neither day, nor night
Can refuse the image of my sight

Neither morning, nor evening I am the same
I enter the waters and let go my name
The proof of my deeds torn
I enter a killer and I am a killer no more...

Let my mind soar...
Teller of this lore....
You deserve more...
Let go of this gore...
