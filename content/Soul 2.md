In the dark, one truth is stark
We are wretches in rich sweat
So with the night I will kill it all
the wickedness, the awful regret

As I fall prey to my bed on moats
I search my mind for reason of this treason
but all purpose left with the remaining boats
but, hey, at least it makes sense, its the coming of the worst season.
