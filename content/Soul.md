In the frost, I have been waiting
for the colden wind to dissipate me 
or for you to finally search for me,
you left me here just a day ago
but the days have gone by so slow.

Another went by, but you forgot to close the door
the coldness didn't kill your friends,
they decided it was best to open the window
and since then I've been freezing, oh, so slow.

Friend of friends, our endurance will fade with a tide of sorrow,
it might be high time we ended this loathe for the sake of our kin.
Let us complete each other in a conforming oath â€“
you will wash me once, I will kill your sin.
