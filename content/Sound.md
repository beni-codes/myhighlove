When the world has me surrounded
I defend myself with sound
my mind turns square and round
my reaction, I will try to make profound

But then my clique gets affected
to my mind they try to reflect
what they see as right in retrospect
but, in turn, we lose the platform which gave us sense

And if my shield of sound is close to broken
I will be bound to make choice - to raise sword or run
and I won't do the latter regardless of moon or sun
so i'm sorry that it must be done - we must become undone

---

*Oh, lonesome, won't you find somewhere to fit?
a nomad, forsaken by all
only I can take your fall
you know me - your [[Soul]]*

No, please, stay with me, or I can't ever turn to be
the one they deserve to see
the one I imagined with glee.
Stay with me, I endlessly plea

You and [[Blood]] forge me,
You and [[Blood]] force me
to see to living even in the coldest night
because, for you, it is worth the most worthless fight

So will you back me in the fight against
[[Misinterpreted, Misunderstood, Mistook]]?
If you can speak then you must be sole to listen.
Do you tend to my cry, friend who will try?
