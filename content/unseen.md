In the shattered desert I wanted to be stranded,
in the shattered desert another landed.

Both men explicitly denied the truth,
we started cluelessly to search for soothe,
but the dark night reminded us
we were in some way in the same sort of bane.

Turns out it didn't take a lot, just a quiet 'hey'
and from the sand emerged a glass pane
to remind us we live and die the same
and I think that that is sane.

And our glass pane will sear unto us our pain
to remind us of the fight where there was a friend to gain,
honour to unrestrain and darkness to abolish in disdain,
because solely through it I can know to discern love from bane.

Thank you, friend,
for being true,
I can do the same for you!
